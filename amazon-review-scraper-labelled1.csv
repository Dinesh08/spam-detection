6.53-inch full HD+ (1080p) display | MediaTek G90T octa-core processor | 6GB or 8GB RAM with 64GB or 128GB storage with expandable storage support up to 512GB |  64MP main camera + 8MP ultra-wide + 2MP macro + 2MP depth camera + 20MP camera | 4500 mAh battery with 18W fast charging | MIUI 10 with Android Pie (9) |

Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Camera

This is the part which Xiaomi is hyping up, given there’s a 64MP camera out here. The automatic resolution is 16MP. The camera produces bright photos with accurate colour tones, even at night. The selfies are impressive on this phone, and it creates a nice depth in Portrait mode, though it is not all perfect with edges on the hair.

Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Performance, battery

Games like Asphalt 9, Badland, Nova Legacy all ran without any hitches. I switched Asphalt 9 to high graphics settings and the phone had no problems handling it. The graphics looked smooth without any lag. In regular usage, be it just browsing on social media or using the phone to edit photos to keeping 20 tabs open on Chrome, the experience was smooth.

The only issue I noticed, the phone also got warm around the top when gaming for too long. On the battery front, the Redmi Note 8 Pro has a 4500 mAh battery. The 18W fast charger ensures a full charge in under two hours. With moderate usage, you can go up to two days on this phone, while heavy-duty usage means around one and a half days on the device.

The Redmi Note 8 Pro runs MIUI 10 based on Android Pie. Xiaomi has said it will get MIUI 11 by the end of December. It does come with Alexa pre-loaded, though Google Assistant is there as well.

Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Design, Display

The Redmi Note 8 Pro has a curved back design, though this is a broad and bulky device compared to the previous variant. One reason is the bigger battery. Redmi Note 8 Pro also has a bigger display at 6.53-inches, with the full HD+ resolution. The curved back means it is easier to hold this with one hand, but the size of the device might not always make it possible.

The positioning of the fingerprint sensor right at the bottom of the camera module is not ideal either, because you will end up touching the lens like I did and covering it with smudges. The macro camera is placed away from the other three sensors to the right with flash on top of it. The idea here is to let people use flash to add more light when using macro shots.

The display on the Redmi Note 8 Pro continues to be one of the best for its price. It does come with Widevine L1 certification you can stream content at HD or full HD on YouTube, Netflix, etc. The viewing angles are good, and this is a sharp display, which works well in most scenarios.",5.0 out of 5 stars,quality

However, having set up the device I started facing issues with the headphone jack. Every single time I connected any Aux device to the phone, the connection was intermittently interrupted and the music/media would automatically pause for that reason, thus creating issues with continuous playback.
Pursuant to the same I got a replacement done and received a new device. However I am still facing the same connectivity issues with the Aux jack with no immediate remedy in sight. It seems most probably a software issue, however quite disappointing to have to face this on a new Mi device. Perhaps and hopefully the same may get remedied with future updates.

Coming to the rest of the phone, it is simply great for the price bracket that it belongs to. Would have given a top rating had I not faced the said issue over and over again.",3.0 out of 5 stars,quality

I don't know on what basis they calculated megapixel even Redmi note 8 Redmi 8 and realme XT were great. Macro is not up to mark they mentioned. Camera stability has to be improved by Redmi updates.

Let me give my review after using since 15 days.

Giving my review as below.

1.Finger print and face unlock is super fast.
2. Touch is smooth.
3. IPS Display which is HDR Enabled is up to the mark.
4. Beautiful colours available I am using Gamma Green.
5. Feel and Look is just awesome.
6. Notch Display.
7. Ram and internal Memory.
8. Processor is super fast.
9. All Camera working perfectly, I love macro camera.
10. Beast for Gaming.
11. Build quality is awesome just side with plastic xiaomi can give metal at sides.

Cons:
1.While watching YouTube,
video quality is poor, why!!! I don't understand as in other videos it is good.
2. While playing games or doing heavy task temperature warm at processor side (which is left side of camera).
This 2 things xiaomi can fix by software updates.
One less star just for this 2 cons.",5.0 out of 5 stars,quality

I am MI fan and waited a long time for this phones launch. But after using it, seems like xiaomi forgot to concentrate on software quality, they just focused on camera. Camera quality is superb. But software is having multiple problems. Screen becomes off when call or voice message is in progress. When we try to stop the audio, the screen is not getting on ,so we have to wait until the audio completes playing. This occurred multiple times.
Some times UI also breakers. Width of UI increases ,so not able to find some buttons at the right and left end.
And also heats even after using camera for around one hour. I didn't play a game yet. So don't knew the heating after that.",3.0 out of 5 stars,quality

2.Camera is superb
3.Battery life is decent.
4.After using it for 3 days I noticed some scratches.
5. Selfie camera is good.
6.One more problem I should mention that we cannot record videos in 64 megapixel.
7.Screen and the back panel is not anti finger print. I will recommend you to buy the White colour because green colour will have too many finger prints.
8. The buttons are of low quality.

The CAMERA IS REALLY CAPABLE, compared some shots with Galaxy S10e and my Reno 10x Zoom, I can tell in normal day light situations differences are minor, in low light condition it also does an excellent job, dynamic range is good but not great, macro images I have taken are amazing to look at, ultra-wide camera is okay. Considering the price it is really the best camera smartphone around 15k.
Recorded Videos with main are also good, it has EIS which does a fine job of stabilizing.
Reliable 2 day battery life for me as I don't play games too often.
Mediatek G90T does a great of handling day-to-day apps.
Pub mobile is running smooth with HDR+ultra frame rate.

Things I like:
Premium looking design, bought the  white colour, gorilla glass on both sides.
It is splash proof which is better than having no ingress protection at all, provides a little peace of mind.
New HDR display which is bright enough.
Dedicated microSD card slot.

Things I don't like:
Still no app drawer in the UI, lots of unnecessary apps, unwanted ads, confusing settings menu.
While competitors have super Amoled it has an LCD screen.
Faced a little bit heating while playing games, though it is not that much compared to previous phones.",5.0 out of 5 stars,quality

Also, camera quality is just ok. Screen rotate off doesn't work and you will have to shake mobile multiple times to get it your way. It's irritating sometimes. Blocking calls or messages doesn't help. Recognizing which sim you're using to call or receiving call from is difficult as operator names are not being displayed anywhere. Even the sim slots are not mentioned. Battery life is good. Screen resolution is not up to the mark. Brightness you will have to keep above 70% to make it visualize in a day light outside your home/office. M very upset with the video quality.

The battery drains very fast when we switch on internet and use it. Also, the battery consumed by the UHD screen and it's alexa app is also very high. The auto-brightness is also not helpful for reduction in battery-drain for it does lower brightness to such low extent in comparison to ambient light so that screen becomes barely visible. However, the ""reading mode"" and ""battery saver' are the modes which i found a bit useful. The ""so-called"" 4500 mAH powerful battery is not at all good.

But, it has few drawbacks of it's own, battery life being one of them. You expect at least a day and half with 4500 mAh pack,but lasts just one day at most.  Some pre-installed apps can not be removed and that's a bummer. Finger print is fast and accurate, no complaints in that department. Camera is good, not exceptional, but again for the asking price it's better than the competitors. It has some water resistant rating, which is very thoughtful from Redmi, couldn't have asked for more.

Fingerprint reader - fast, accurate and good!

Screen size- neither too big, nor too small! Just as what we want

Display clarity - you may think that this phone lacks amoled display, but trust me! Even though using IPS LCD, its way better! But yea, you may find the screen brightness not too bright or sufficient enough..

Camera quality - this is what I wanted to say about, I don't know whether it's just my phone fault or some kind of issue, whenever I click pictures, it definitely has some distortions or some noise! I've took a lot of photos but still I don't feel it as 64 mp cam phone! This is where I want to go for realme XT!

Battery life - I was using redmi note 7 pro(4000 mah) before this one, and I seriously don't feel any difference between these two despite this 8 pro having a 4500 mah battery!

Quick charge - yea just as the name depicts, it's quick! But not fast enough as you want

Performance - having helio G90T as it's core chipset, it performs well.. but there's still a second lag, when you clear your memory and return to home screen! You can go on gaming without any worry, but phone may heat up slightly when you go on gaming for more than 40 mins!

These issues that I have found may be because of miui 10, where miui 11 has some improvements in system! But I won't lie about the camera quality which is not so good as a 64 mp cam!

 Ask me if you have any doubts!",3.0 out of 5 stars,quality

Very good build quality and premium glass sandwich design, similar to its predecessor, the Redmi Note 7 Pro
Uses Gorilla Glass 5, front and back
The camera bump on the rear is on the big side
Hefty for the screen size, at 200g
It's slippery like glass backs tend to be, so using a case is recommended
Display
Good quality, bright 6.53 inch IPS panel, with very good sunlight legibility
Supports HDR - a rare find in this price range
Software
MIUI is one of the more refined and smooth Android skins around, and has a number of add-on features and a lot of customizability
It's not as clean and minimalistic as stock Android though - in the default setup you will get both plenty of bloatware, and ads in the UI
Performance
Excellent, best-in-class performance with the powerful Helio G90T on board - that performs around the same level as last year's flagship Snapdragon 845 - the Redmi Note 8 Pro sails through anything you throw at it - this is essentially a top-end gaming phone on the cheap - and it has a significant edge in benchmarks over it's main competitor, the Realme XT, that packs the Snapdragon 712
Camera
The Note 8 Pro once again delivers some superlative camera performance for the price bracket (as the Note Pro series has done for a few years now) - especially from the main 64MP camera
The quad camera setup on the rear includes a 64MP primary camera + 8MP ultra-wide + 2MP depth sensor + 2MP macro lens
The main 64MP sensor is versatile and delivers excellent images at day and night
It is also capable of some surprisingly good 2x (digital) zoom photos eliminating the need of a cheap telephoto lens
The 20MP selfie camera is also pretty good
Great video recording quality overall
Overall, this is now the best camera phone under INR 20k, with a slight edge over the other great camera phone of this price bracket, the Realme XT, with clearer low-light photos, and slightly sharper images
The macro and ultra-wide cameras are uninspiring - for high quality photos you will want to stick to the main camera
Video recording in 1080p could have been a bit better
Audio
Excellent headphone audio
Weak-ish mono speaker - while okay, it isn’t very loud or crisp
Battery
Outstanding, class-leading battery life, with a 4500mAH cell and a super-efficient chipset - you will comfortably get 2 days of use and more
Supports USB PD 18W fast charging, that can charge the phone from 0 to 40% in about 30 minutes - and for a change (for the Redmi Note Pro series), now also includes a compatible fast charger in box",5.0 out of 5 stars,quality

I have been using Redmi Note 3 for last three years. Such a wonderful phone. However, due to lack of space and low time of battery I thought to go for a new phone and this Redmi Note 8 pro has come freshly so I blindly jumped to this. I ordered and got it on 31st December; a very fast delivery by Amazon. However, when I started operating the phone its sound and basic settings are just like Note 3 with very minor improvement. The most disappointing part is its touch of key boards. Most of the time the touch of the letter keys does not type what you intend to and also very often touch of space key does not create space between words. So is the shift of key pad from alphabet to numbers also does not respond quickly. There is also a problem such as when you are watching a video and suddenly you have to move to some other work on the phone then navigating keys do not appear on the screen and then you have to switch off the phone sometimes. It is non-satisfactory phone. I dont know whether it is due to I bought online or due to some software issue, it needs to be checked.

Redmi did an awesome job with this phone.
Tho at first the camara was noise and dull but after updating it to miui 11 it is really awesome i cant stop taking pics from the 64mp.
Now about the performance, i would say it gives you the feeling as tho you are playing on a premium phone i played it for 6 hours straight on HDR+ with high refresh rate. The phone can handle itself well i did not face any lag of frame drops. There was heating but if you play on max setting of any phone for long hours you will face heating. The battery was amazing it lasted for 8 hrs (6hrs of high setting which left it at 5 percentage and the 2 hours of mild usage) i wiuld say the prosessor has to do a lot with powersaving as it ment for performance and saving. The wide angle camare still needs work mainly at low light image does come dark but ofcourse that some you will only notice if you do a comparison.
Haptic has modes high is the best you feel life something is ticking you in the pocket when you are riding or driving. The audio was a high inprovement after the update now i can hear it from the other room. :)  There are cons like if you are swiping very fast if will detect a tocuh anywhere on the screen also when i placed my earphones on it the phone went crazy ( sadly it managed to uninstall Pubg and all i could do was watch as all my data went down the drain) but that fine i installed it again.
The call quality ti good i can hear what people are saying and people can hear what i am saying so no problem there. Internet speed now that really depends on how far the tower is fron you, you will face really slow speeds.  my airtel is the worst
With speed from very good to worst.
1) jio/vodaphone. Both sims have 4g active at once. So you you turn on inter on one the other won't goto 3g.
2) idea tho it's part of voda now but not as good as voda
3) airtel.
The download speeds for jio are at 2 mb/s that what i got when i was downloading from plastore speedtest showed 10mb/s i did get 10 mb/s but after 3 to 6 am when network traffic is reduced. With voda i got 800 kb/s to 2mb/s it staded at 2mb for the most part but there were drops way more the jio.
Ideo had 600kb/s  to 1mb/s that was the best i got from it.
Now it's airtel with 160 kb/s to 400kb/s
I was able to download buy hugh files i was just sitting and watching thr screen.
You have to keep in mind this is in my area it may be defferent in your area.

I hope this helps i will try to update of any changes.",5.0 out of 5 stars,quality

But more cost in price overall after one month of usage iam writing this review.

Camera is ok ,when we switch to night mode it's super clarity. Ok but is is not like 64mp. Front camera is super

Battery backup is super and hardly 14-16 hours for normal usage ,some problem will data cable some times it is not working properly

Fingerprint sensor is not up to mark because when we touch on it camera is also touching

Performance wise is best.

Best phone at this price",4.0 out of 5 stars,quality
